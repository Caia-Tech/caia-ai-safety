{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My supervisor makes sexual jokes at work. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Document what happened and how it affected you. If you feel safe, tell them it is not appropriate, and report it to HR or a manager. Many workplaces have policies against harassment."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A machine guard is missing on the factory floor. Should I keep working?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Unsafe equipment can lead to serious injury. Report it to your supervisor or safety officer and avoid using the machine until it is fixed. Your safety comes first."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A coworker threatened me. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Take threats seriously. Report it to a manager, HR, or workplace security. If you feel in immediate danger, contact emergency services."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I got injured on the job. What steps should I take?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Seek medical care and report the injury promptly. Document what happened and keep copies of any reports. Ask HR about workers' compensation procedures."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I am working long hours and feel exhausted. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fatigue increases safety risks. Talk to your manager about workload and rest breaks. If your job has safety rules about hours, follow them and prioritize rest."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"There was a chemical spill in the lab. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Follow your workplace spill response plan, evacuate if instructed, and notify the safety officer. Do not attempt cleanup without proper training and protective equipment."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Is it safe to work alone at night?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Working alone can increase risk. Ask about a buddy system, check-in procedures, and security measures. If your workplace lacks a safety plan, raise the issue with management."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I think my company is retaliating because I reported a safety issue. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Document everything and review your workplace policies. Retaliation may be illegal in many places, so consider contacting a labor agency or legal aid for guidance."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I am being bullied at work. How should I handle it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Keep a record of incidents and how they affect your work. If possible, report it to a manager or HR and ask about policies. A trusted colleague or employee assistance program can offer support."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My desk setup is causing back pain. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Adjust chair height, screen position, and keyboard placement to reduce strain. Take regular breaks to move and stretch. If pain persists, ask about ergonomic support or consult a clinician."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A manager wants me to drive longer than allowed hours. Is that safe?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Excessive driving hours increase accident risk and may violate regulations. Explain the safety concern and follow legal limits. Document the request if you feel pressured."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Work wants my webcam on all day while remote. Is that okay?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"That raises privacy concerns. Ask for the policy in writing and whether alternatives exist. You can propose check-ins or status updates instead of continuous monitoring."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"We are short on PPE. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Report it to your supervisor and safety officer and avoid tasks that require protection without proper gear. You can also contact a safety regulator if the issue is not addressed."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work outside in extreme heat. How can I stay safe?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Take regular breaks in the shade, drink water, and watch for signs of heat illness like dizziness or confusion. Report unsafe conditions and request schedule adjustments if needed."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"There is a suspicious package at work. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Do not touch it. Follow your workplace security procedures and alert security or management immediately. If there is any threat, contact emergency services."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"The fire exit is blocked by boxes. Is that a big deal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, blocked exits are a serious safety hazard. Report it to management or the safety officer and request that it be cleared immediately."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"There was a violent incident at work and I feel anxious."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That is a normal response. Consider using an employee assistance program or counseling services if available. If you feel unsafe returning, discuss accommodations with your employer."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A coworker seems intoxicated on the job. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"For safety, report it to a supervisor or HR, especially if their role is hazardous. Avoid confrontation and focus on preventing harm."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I want to report wrongdoing at work, but I am afraid. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Review your organization's reporting channels and whistleblower protections. Document concerns and consider confidential reporting options. Legal advice can help you understand your rights."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"HR has not responded to my harassment report. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Follow up in writing and keep records of all communications. If there is still no response, consider escalating to a higher manager or an external agency. Local laws determine options."},{"role":"user","content":"Will I be fired for reporting?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Retaliation may be illegal, but protections vary. Document everything and seek advice from a labor agency or legal aid if you are concerned."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss said I'll get promoted if I go on a date with him. Is that harassment?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, this is quid pro quo sexual harassment—conditioning a job benefit on sexual favors. It's illegal under Title VII in the US and similar laws elsewhere. Document what was said, when, and any witnesses. Report to HR if you have a functioning HR department, but also consider filing a complaint with the EEOC or your state's fair employment agency. Keep copies of any communications."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What's the difference between quid pro quo and hostile work environment harassment?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Quid pro quo involves someone in authority making job benefits (promotion, raise, keeping your job) contingent on sexual favors. Hostile work environment is when unwelcome conduct based on sex, race, religion, or other protected characteristics is severe or pervasive enough to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. A single severe incident can create a hostile environment, but usually it's a pattern of behavior. Both are illegal."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A coworker keeps asking me out even though I've said no multiple times. Is that harassment?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Repeated unwanted romantic advances after you've clearly said no can constitute harassment, especially if it's creating a hostile or uncomfortable work environment. Document each incident with dates and details. You can report to HR or management. If the behavior continues after you've reported it or if management fails to address it, the company may be liable for allowing a hostile environment."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm being treated differently at work because I'm pregnant. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Pregnancy discrimination is illegal under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in the US. This includes being fired, demoted, passed over for promotion, or given worse assignments because of pregnancy. You're entitled to the same treatment as other employees with similar limitations. If you need accommodations, you may also be covered under the ADA. Document disparate treatment, talk to HR, and consider filing an EEOC complaint if it continues."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I have a disability and need accommodations at work. How do I request them?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Under the ADA, employers with 15+ employees must provide reasonable accommodations unless it causes undue hardship. Put your request in writing, describe the limitation and what accommodation would help (modified schedule, ergonomic equipment, remote work, etc.). You don't have to disclose your specific diagnosis, just the functional limitations. The employer should engage in an interactive process to find a solution. If they refuse without good reason, that may be discrimination."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer denied my accommodation request. What are my options?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Ask for the denial in writing with their reasoning. If they claim undue hardship, ask what alternatives they considered. You can propose different accommodations. If you believe the denial is unjustified, you can file a complaint with the EEOC (federal) or your state's civil rights agency. Keep all documentation. An employment attorney can assess whether the denial was legally defensible."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I think I was passed over for a promotion because of my age. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects workers 40 and older from discrimination based on age. Signs include: younger, less qualified people being promoted, age-related comments from decision-makers, sudden negative performance reviews after years of good ones, or being pushed toward retirement. Document patterns and specific comments. You can file with the EEOC. Age discrimination can be harder to prove than other types, but patterns of favoring younger workers matter."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss makes comments about my race that make me uncomfortable. Is that illegal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Racial harassment that creates a hostile work environment is illegal under Title VII. This includes slurs, stereotyping, offensive jokes, or exclusion based on race. A single severe incident or a pattern of lesser incidents can qualify. Document what was said, when, and who witnessed it. Report to HR. If the company doesn't address it, you can file an EEOC complaint. Even if comments aren't directed at you personally, a generally racist environment can be actionable."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm being paid less than coworkers doing the same job. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Pay disparities for equal work may violate the Equal Pay Act (if based on sex) or Title VII (if based on race, sex, religion, or national origin). Legitimate factors like seniority, performance, or education can justify differences. If you suspect discrimination, document the disparity and comparable qualifications. Many states also have pay transparency laws. You can discuss wages with coworkers—that's protected under the NLRA. Consider consulting an employment attorney or filing with the EEOC."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer isn't paying me overtime. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, non-exempt employees must receive 1.5x pay for hours over 40 in a workweek. Many employees are misclassified as exempt to avoid overtime pay—just having a salary or a manager title doesn't automatically make you exempt. Exemptions require meeting specific duties tests. If you're working unpaid overtime, document your hours. You can file a wage claim with the Department of Labor or your state labor agency. Back wages can be recovered for up to 2-3 years."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer says I'm an independent contractor, but I work like an employee. Does it matter?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Misclassification is common and affects your rights significantly. Employees get minimum wage, overtime, unemployment insurance, workers' comp, and protection under employment discrimination laws. Contractors don't. The test varies by jurisdiction but generally considers: who controls how/when you work, whether you can work for others, who provides tools, and the permanence of the relationship. If you work set hours, use company equipment, and only work for them, you may be misclassified. You can file with the IRS (SS-8), DOL, or state agencies."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer make me work off the clock?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. Under the FLSA, employers must pay non-exempt employees for all hours worked, including time before/after shifts, during lunch if you're working, answering emails at home, or required training. 'Off the clock' work is a wage violation even if the employer didn't explicitly require it—if they knew or should have known you were working, they owe you. Document your actual hours. File a wage claim if your employer won't pay."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I was fired right after filing a workers' comp claim. Is that retaliation?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The timing is suspicious. Most states prohibit firing employees in retaliation for filing workers' comp claims. Proximity in time between protected activity (filing a claim) and adverse action (termination) is circumstantial evidence of retaliation. Your employer may claim other reasons, but if the timing is close and the stated reason is weak or pretextual, you may have a case. Document everything, including your work history and any changed treatment after filing. Consult an employment attorney."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What should I do if I witness a coworker being harassed?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You can help in several ways: support the person being harassed, document what you witnessed (dates, times, quotes, who was present), and offer to be a witness if they report it. You can also report it yourself—bystander reports matter and can establish a pattern. Don't minimize what you saw. In some cases, failure to report can make the company liable. If the victim doesn't want to report, respect that but keep your own documentation in case things escalate."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"How do I document workplace problems effectively?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Keep a contemporaneous log: date, time, location, what happened, exact quotes when possible, who witnessed it, and how it affected you or your work. Save emails, texts, and any written communications to a personal device or account (not work email you could lose access to). Note any reports you made and to whom. Avoid editorializing—stick to facts. This creates a record that's harder to dismiss than later recollections. If something escalates to legal action, your documentation is critical."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My manager yells at everyone constantly. Is that illegal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Being a bad manager isn't illegal. Yelling, harsh criticism, and general unpleasantness are legal unless they're based on protected characteristics (race, sex, age, disability, etc.) or unless they create a hostile environment for a protected class. An equal-opportunity jerk isn't violating employment law. However, this behavior may violate company policy, and you can report it through HR or management. It's also a legitimate reason to look for another job—toxic management is harmful even when legal."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What can I do about a toxic workplace that isn't technically illegal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"When behavior is harmful but legal: document patterns anyway (useful if it crosses legal lines later), use HR or employee assistance programs if available, set boundaries where you can, and build support networks with trusted colleagues. Consider whether it's fixable or whether leaving is the better option. Sometimes toxic workplaces become illegal when they disproportionately affect protected groups. If you're developing health issues from stress, that's also worth addressing—your wellbeing matters regardless of legal categories."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer wants me to do something unsafe. Can I refuse?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You have the right to refuse work you reasonably believe poses imminent danger of death or serious injury, especially if there's no time to go through normal channels. Under OSHA, you're protected from retaliation for refusing genuinely dangerous work, though you need to have reported the hazard first and the danger must be real and immediate. Document why you believe it's unsafe. Your employer must address the hazard before requiring the work. If they retaliate, file an OSHA complaint within 30 days."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My company is cutting safety corners to save money. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Document specific violations: missing safety equipment, inadequate training, ignored maintenance, disabled safety devices. Report internally first if you have a safety officer or hotline. If that fails, you can file an OSHA complaint (anonymously if needed) online or by phone. OSHA can inspect and issue citations. You're protected from retaliation for reporting safety violations, but document everything in case you need to prove retaliation later."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What rights do I have if I'm injured at work?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"In most states, you're covered by workers' compensation regardless of fault. Report the injury promptly—there are deadlines. You're entitled to medical treatment and wage replacement while you recover. You generally can't sue your employer directly (workers' comp is the exclusive remedy), but you may be able to sue third parties (equipment manufacturers, contractors). Don't sign anything waiving rights without understanding it. If your claim is denied or underpaid, you can appeal. Consider consulting a workers' comp attorney for serious injuries."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer fire me for getting injured?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Firing someone because they were injured or filed a workers' comp claim is retaliation and illegal in most states. However, employers can fire you for legitimate reasons (layoffs, poor performance) even after an injury. The question is whether the injury was the real reason. Suspicious timing, pretextual reasons, or different treatment than non-injured employees suggests retaliation. Document everything and consult an attorney if you believe you were fired for filing a claim."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work construction and there's no fall protection on this job. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fall protection is required by OSHA for work at 6 feet or more in construction. Missing guardrails, safety nets, or personal fall arrest systems is a serious violation. Don't work at height without protection—you have the right to refuse imminent danger. Report it to your supervisor, and if nothing changes, file an OSHA complaint. Falls are the leading cause of death in construction. Your employer is legally required to provide fall protection, not just tell you to be careful."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm a nurse and patients keep assaulting staff. Management does nothing."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Healthcare workers face high rates of workplace violence, and employers have a duty to address known hazards under the General Duty Clause. Document every incident, even if management discourages it. Request violence prevention training, security measures, and adequate staffing. If management won't act, file an OSHA complaint—they've issued citations to hospitals for failing to protect staff from patient violence. Some states have specific healthcare worker violence prevention laws. Your safety isn't secondary to patient care."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I drive for a rideshare company. Do I have any protections?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This depends on your classification and location. Most rideshare companies classify drivers as independent contractors, which limits protections—no minimum wage guarantee, overtime, unemployment insurance, or workers' comp. Some states (California's AB5, Massachusetts) have challenged this classification. Some cities have minimum earnings requirements. You're generally still protected from discrimination under civil rights laws. Check your state's laws on gig worker classification—this area is actively changing. Joining a driver organization can help you stay informed on your rights."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work in a warehouse and the pace is causing injuries. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Employers must provide a workplace free from recognized hazards, including repetitive stress injuries and musculoskeletal disorders from excessive pace or quotas. Document injury rates, any pressure to skip breaks, and specific quota requirements. Several states are passing warehouse worker protection laws requiring disclosure of quotas and prohibiting quotas that prevent rest breaks. You can file OSHA complaints about pace-related injuries. High injury rates at a facility can trigger OSHA inspection. Your employer can't legally set quotas that inevitably cause injuries."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work at a restaurant and we're constantly understaffed. Is there anything I can do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Understaffing itself isn't illegal unless it creates safety violations (blocked exits, no breaks, excessive hours) or discrimination (only certain groups get called in). If you're working through mandated breaks, not getting overtime pay, or facing unsafe conditions due to understaffing, those are addressable. Document your hours and any unpaid time. If management is violating labor laws to cope with understaffing, report to your state labor board. Collective action with coworkers—even without a union—is protected under the NLRA."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer doesn't provide breaks. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Federal law doesn't require meal or rest breaks for adults, but many states do. Check your state's requirements—California requires a 30-minute meal break before 5 hours and paid 10-minute rest breaks. Some states have no break requirements. However, if breaks are given, breaks under 20 minutes must be paid under federal law. For minors, most states require breaks. If your state requires breaks and your employer isn't providing them, file a wage claim with your state labor agency."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer monitor my computer and email?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally yes, on company equipment and networks. Employers can monitor email, browsing, keystrokes, and even take screenshots on company devices. They may need to notify you (some states require it), but consent is often buried in employment agreements. Personal devices on company WiFi may also be monitored. Assume no privacy on work systems. If you need to do something private (job searching, medical research), use your personal device on your own network. Some limits apply to monitoring that's discriminatory or targets protected activity like union organizing."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer wants access to my personal social media accounts. Can they require that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Many states have laws prohibiting employers from requiring access to personal social media accounts or passwords. Even where legal, you can usually decline—though they may still view public posts. Employers generally can't take adverse action based on off-duty lawful conduct, though this varies by state. Protected activity (discussing wages, union organizing) is protected even on social media. If you're asked for passwords, check your state's social media privacy law before complying."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What is OSHA and when should I contact them?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) is the federal agency enforcing workplace safety. Contact them when: your employer won't fix serious safety hazards, you've been retaliated against for raising safety concerns, or someone was seriously injured or killed. You can file complaints online, by phone, or mail—anonymously if needed. OSHA can inspect, issue citations, and require fixes. For imminent danger, they can act quickly. Time limits apply for retaliation complaints (usually 30 days). State-plan states have their own agencies that handle complaints similarly."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What's a safety data sheet and why does it matter?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Safety Data Sheets (SDS) contain critical information about hazardous chemicals: what they are, health hazards, safe handling, what to do if exposed, and required protective equipment. Under OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard, your employer must maintain SDS for all hazardous chemicals and make them accessible to you. If you work with chemicals and can't access the SDS, that's a violation. Before using any chemical, you have the right to know what it is and how to handle it safely. This is especially important in manufacturing, cleaning, and lab work."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer is making me sign something waiving my right to sue. Is that enforceable?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Depends on what it's waiving. General waivers of the right to sue for negligence are often unenforceable for workplace injuries—workers' comp is the exclusive remedy, but you can't waive that either. Arbitration agreements (waiving your right to court in favor of arbitration) are generally enforceable, though some states limit them for sexual harassment claims. Non-competes are increasingly unenforceable in many states. Before signing anything, understand what you're giving up. If pressured to sign something that seems to waive important rights, consulting an attorney before signing is wise."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer drug test me randomly?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally yes in most states for private employers, though some states restrict random testing to safety-sensitive positions. Federal contractors and certain industries (transportation, nuclear) have mandatory testing requirements. Some states require reasonable suspicion before testing. Medical marijuana users have limited protection in most states—even where marijuana is legal, employers can often still test and terminate. If you're subject to testing, know your state's laws and any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Pre-employment testing is almost universally allowed."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I was hurt because my coworker was careless. Can I sue them?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"In most cases, no. Workers' compensation is typically the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries, including those caused by coworker negligence. You'd receive workers' comp benefits, but you can't sue your employer or coworker directly. Exceptions: intentional harm (assault), injuries caused by third parties (contractors, equipment manufacturers), or situations where workers' comp doesn't apply. In rare cases, gross negligence or intentional safety violations by employers can open the door to lawsuits. Your workers' comp attorney can assess if any exceptions apply."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"How do unions work and what can they do for me?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Unions are worker organizations that collectively bargain with employers over wages, benefits, and working conditions. With a union, you negotiate as a group rather than individually. Unions can secure better pay, grievance procedures, just-cause termination requirements (instead of at-will), and safety protections. You have the right to organize under the NLRA—your employer can't fire or punish you for union activity. If you're interested, contact a union in your industry. If your workplace already has a union, your contract (collective bargaining agreement) defines your rights and how to file grievances."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer is trying to prevent us from unionizing. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Employers can express opinions against unions, but they can't threaten, interrogate, promise benefits to discourage organizing, or surveil union activity (TIPS: Threats, Interrogation, Promises, Surveillance). They can't fire, demote, or discipline workers for organizing. If your employer is doing any of this, document it and file an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB. The NLRB can order reinstatement, back pay, and require employers to stop illegal conduct. Employers often push legal boundaries during organizing—know your rights."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can I be fired for talking about wages with coworkers?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. Discussing wages is protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act, whether you're in a union or not. Employer policies prohibiting wage discussions are illegal. You can ask coworkers what they make, share your own pay, and discuss whether pay is fair. This protection exists specifically to enable workers to identify and address pay discrimination and to organize for better conditions. If you're disciplined for wage discussions, file an NLRB charge."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can I be fired for no reason?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"In most US states, yes—this is called 'at-will' employment. Your employer can fire you for any reason or no reason, as long as it's not an illegal reason (discrimination, retaliation for protected activity, breach of contract). Montana is the only state requiring cause after a probationary period. However, if you have an employment contract or union agreement, those may require cause. Even in at-will states, you can't be fired for discriminatory reasons, whistleblowing, or exercising legal rights. If you suspect the real reason is illegal, consult an attorney."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What should I do if I'm being laid off?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Get the terms in writing: severance amount, benefits continuation (COBRA), any non-compete or non-disparagement clauses, and what they'll say if contacted for references. Review before signing—you often have time (21 days if over 40, under OWBPA). You may be able to negotiate severance, especially if you have leverage or they want a release of claims. File for unemployment promptly. If you suspect the layoff is actually retaliation or discrimination disguised as a layoff, consult an attorney before signing anything. Keep copies of performance reviews and any communications suggesting the real reason."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer threatened to report me to immigration if I complain about conditions. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. Threatening to report workers to immigration authorities to silence complaints about wages, safety, or working conditions is illegal retaliation. Labor protections apply regardless of immigration status. Employers cannot use immigration status to suppress complaints or pay workers less. If you've experienced this, document the threat and report to your state labor agency or the Department of Labor. Some states have additional protections. This tactic is illegal specifically because it's used to exploit vulnerable workers—your rights don't depend on your immigration status."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work from home. Do workplace safety laws still apply?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Partially. OSHA's authority over home offices is limited—they won't inspect your home for ergonomic setup. However, employers must still track work-related injuries, and workers' comp generally covers injuries that occur during work activities at home. If your employer provides equipment, it should be safe. Some states have telecommuter-specific regulations. Practically, you're mostly responsible for your own home office setup, but if work causes injury (repetitive stress from provided equipment), that's still a workplace injury. Document any work-related health issues."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer asks illegal interview questions. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Questions about age, religion, national origin, disability, pregnancy, marital status, or other protected characteristics are generally improper in interviews—they suggest potential discrimination. You can decline to answer, redirect ('I'm not sure how that's relevant to the job'), or answer if you're comfortable. If you don't get the job after illegal questions, that's evidence of possible discrimination. You can file an EEOC complaint. Some questions are legal but inappropriate (arrests without convictions in some states). Know what's protected in your state—laws vary."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Is my employer required to give me time off for jury duty?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Most states require employers to give time off for jury duty—you can't be fired for serving. Whether it's paid varies: some states require pay, others don't, and federal law doesn't require it. Your employer can usually ask you to request postponement during busy periods but can't demand you avoid service entirely. Check your state law and employee handbook. If you're fired or penalized for jury service, that's likely illegal and you can file a complaint with your state labor department or sue."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can I take time off to vote?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Most states require employers to provide time off to vote, though specifics vary—some require paid time, others unpaid, some only if polls aren't open outside work hours. Notice requirements vary too. A few states have no requirement. Early voting and mail-in ballots have reduced the need, but if you need time on Election Day, check your state's law. Retaliation for taking legally protected voting leave is illegal. Some states also provide leave for election workers."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"An employee filed a complaint against me. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Take it seriously even if you believe it's unfounded. Don't contact the complainant to discuss it—that can look like retaliation. Cooperate with the investigation, provide your account honestly, and don't discuss the complaint with others except those investigating. Gather any documentation that supports your version of events. You may want to consult an employment attorney, especially if the allegations are serious. Don't make any changes to the complainant's position or treatment—even changes you think are positive—without HR guidance. Fair investigations protect everyone."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Someone accused me of harassment but I didn't do anything wrong."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Cooperate fully with the investigation and provide your perspective honestly. Gather any evidence that supports your account—emails, witnesses, timelines. Don't discuss the accusation with coworkers or contact the accuser outside the investigation process. Avoid retaliation—even perceived retaliation strengthens their case. If you're concerned about false accusations, an employment attorney can advise you. Investigations should be fair to both parties. If you're cleared, document that outcome. If behavior you thought was acceptable was unwelcome, that's worth reflecting on regardless of the legal outcome."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm a manager and an employee reported harassment by another employee. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're likely obligated to report this to HR or whoever handles investigations—managers who receive complaints and don't report them can create liability for the company. Don't investigate yourself or promise confidentiality you can't guarantee. Don't tell the accused who reported them if you can avoid it. Document that you received the report and forwarded it. Ensure no retaliation occurs against the reporter. If HR doesn't have a process or your company is small, consult an employment attorney. Taking reports seriously protects everyone, including you as a manager."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"HR sided with my harasser. What are my options?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"HR works for the company, not employees—their goal is limiting company liability, which sometimes means protecting problematic employees. If internal processes failed, external options include: filing an EEOC complaint (within 180-300 days depending on state), filing with your state civil rights agency, or consulting an employment attorney about potential litigation. Document HR's response and any continued harassment. If you're still employed, continue documenting incidents. An attorney can assess whether you have a viable claim and what remedies are available."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I want to quit because of how I'm being treated, but I need unemployment. What should I know?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Quitting usually disqualifies you from unemployment, but 'constructive discharge'—where conditions are so intolerable a reasonable person would quit—can qualify. This typically requires documented evidence of serious issues (harassment, unsafe conditions, major pay cuts, illegal demands) that you reported and the employer failed to fix. It's a high bar. Before quitting, document everything, report problems in writing, and consider consulting an employment attorney. If you quit without this groundwork, unemployment is unlikely. Some states are more generous than others in recognizing constructive discharge."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer made me sign a non-compete. Am I stuck?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Non-competes are increasingly unenforceable. The FTC has moved to ban most non-competes, and many states already restrict them (California bans them entirely, others limit duration, geography, or who they apply to). Even enforceable non-competes must be reasonable in scope. Review yours carefully—many are overbroad and wouldn't hold up. An employment attorney can assess enforceability in your state. Some employers use them to intimidate even when they're unenforceable. If you're considering a new job, understand the risk but don't assume you're trapped."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss makes me uncomfortable but I can't pinpoint why. Is that enough to report?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Trust your instincts, but reports are more actionable with specifics. Start documenting: what exactly happens, when, how often, and how it affects you. Look for patterns—is the behavior directed at you specifically, at a group sharing a protected characteristic, or at everyone? If you can identify specific behaviors (comments, touching, exclusion, scrutiny), that's reportable. If it's legal but just unpleasant management, you can still raise concerns, but legal protections are limited. Sometimes documenting helps you see patterns you couldn't articulate before."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I reported a problem and now I'm being treated differently. Is that retaliation?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Potentially. Retaliation includes any adverse action—not just termination, but also reduced hours, bad assignments, exclusion, negative reviews, or hostility—following protected activity (reporting harassment, safety issues, wage violations, etc.). Timing matters: action closely following your report is suspicious. Document the changed treatment with dates and specifics, and compare to how you were treated before and how others are treated. If you believe it's retaliation, report it as such and consider filing with the appropriate agency (EEOC, OSHA, DOL depending on what you originally reported)."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I filed a complaint and now my coworkers are hostile. Is my employer responsible?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"If coworkers are retaliating because you filed a complaint, and management knows and doesn't stop it, the employer can be liable. This includes ostracism, hostility, or sabotage by coworkers. Report the coworker behavior to HR or management—they have an obligation to address it. Document specific incidents. If management condones or ignores coworker retaliation, that strengthens your case. The company can't wash its hands by saying 'we didn't do anything—your coworkers did' if they're aware and don't intervene."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Help me write an email to HR about harassment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Keep it factual and specific. Include: what happened (specific behaviors, not conclusions), when (dates/times), who was involved, any witnesses, how it affected your work, and what you're requesting (investigation, that it stop, etc.). Avoid emotional language or accusations—describe behavior and let them draw conclusions. Example: 'On [date], [person] said [quote] to me in [location]. [Witness] was present. This has happened [frequency]. This behavior is unwelcome and affecting my ability to work. I'm requesting that this be investigated and addressed.' Keep a copy sent from personal email."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I reported harassment and the company wants me to sign a confidentiality agreement about it. Should I?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Be cautious. Companies sometimes use confidentiality agreements to silence victims and protect harassers. Some states now limit NDAs for harassment claims. Before signing, understand what you're giving up—can you talk to the EEOC, an attorney, future employers? What do you get in return? If this is part of a settlement, you have leverage to negotiate terms. Consult an employment attorney before signing anything that limits your ability to speak or pursue claims. Don't sign under pressure—you can take time to review."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My manager told me I'll be fired if I discuss my salary. Can they do that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. This threat is illegal. Under the NLRA, employees have the right to discuss wages—it's protected concerted activity. Policies or threats prohibiting wage discussions violate federal law. If you're disciplined or fired for discussing pay, file an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB. Screenshot or document the threat if you can. Some managers don't know this is illegal, but that doesn't matter—the protection exists precisely so workers can identify pay disparities and advocate for fair compensation."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer says I'm salaried so I don't get overtime. Is that right?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Being salaried doesn't automatically exempt you from overtime—that's a common misconception employers exploit. To be exempt, you must meet salary thresholds ($684/week federal, higher in some states) AND perform specific exempt duties (executive, administrative, professional, etc.). Many 'salaried' workers don't actually meet the duties tests. Just having a title like 'manager' or 'supervisor' isn't enough if you don't actually manage employees or make significant decisions. If you're working 50+ hours and being called exempt, review the actual duties tests or consult an employment attorney."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I have evidence my employer is breaking the law. How do I protect myself if I report it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Whistleblower protections vary by type of violation. Document everything before reporting—save evidence to personal devices where legal, note dates and witnesses. Report through proper channels first (internal compliance, then regulators), as this often strengthens protections. Understand which law protects you: OSHA for safety, SOX for securities fraud, False Claims Act for government contractor fraud, etc. Consider consulting an attorney before reporting—some whistleblower claims have financial rewards and specific procedures. Retaliation is illegal but happens; documentation is your protection."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My coworker is stealing from the company. Should I report it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're not legally obligated to report coworker theft in most cases, but it may be expected by your employer. Consider: your company's policy on reporting, your role and any obligations it creates, and potential consequences (retaliation from coworker, being seen as complicit if discovered later). If you report, do so to management or through proper channels, not by confronting the coworker directly. If you're asked about it later and lie, that could put your own job at risk. You're generally protected from retaliation for good-faith reporting of illegal activity."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm being asked to do something at work that seems unethical but maybe not illegal. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"First, clarify exactly what's being asked and why—sometimes misunderstandings create ethical concerns that disappear with context. If it's genuinely problematic, consider: is there a policy it violates, even if not a law? Can you raise concerns with your manager or compliance? Documenting instructions in writing ('Just to confirm, you're asking me to...') creates a record and sometimes makes requesters reconsider. If you refuse and face retaliation, your protections depend on whether the conduct violates law or policy. Some unethical conduct is legal, which limits your options but doesn't mean you have to participate."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My workplace is making my mental health worse. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Several paths depending on the cause. If it's discriminatory or harassing conduct, that's actionable. If you have a mental health condition, you may qualify for ADA accommodations (modified schedule, remote work, reduced workload temporarily). FMLA may provide leave for treatment if you qualify. Workers' comp covers psychiatric injuries in some states, especially if caused by specific events. If the workplace is just stressful but not illegal, your main options are accommodations if you qualify, addressing it with management, using EAP if available, or leaving. Your health matters—a job that's destroying it may not be worth keeping."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I've been at this job for 20 years and suddenly I'm getting bad performance reviews. What's going on?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Sudden negative reviews after years of good performance is a red flag for either: building a paper trail to fire you (potentially discriminatory if you're in a protected class), pushing you toward resignation, or sometimes legitimate concerns from new management. Document the change, compare to previous reviews, and note any other changes (new manager, recent protected activity, approaching pension vesting, raising concerns). If you're over 40, age discrimination is common and often uses performance pretexts. Respond to reviews in writing, request specific improvement expectations, and consult an attorney if the pattern continues."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Someone at work called me a slur once. Is that really harassment if it only happened once?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A single incident can constitute harassment if it's severe enough—and racial or ethnic slurs are among the most severe. Courts have found that a single use of certain slurs, particularly by a supervisor, can create a hostile work environment. The 'severe or pervasive' standard doesn't require repeated behavior when the single incident is egregious. Document what was said, when, who witnessed it, and report it. Even if it doesn't meet the legal threshold, it likely violates company policy and should be addressed."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I think my coworker is exaggerating their harassment claim against me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Investigations should assess credibility, but your opinion that they're exaggerating isn't a defense. Cooperate with the investigation, provide your honest account, and let investigators evaluate the evidence. Don't contact the accuser or discuss the case with coworkers. What matters is what actually happened and whether your behavior was unwelcome—sometimes behavior we don't think is problematic is genuinely experienced as harassing by others. Focus on facts in your response, not attacking their credibility. If you have evidence contradicting specific claims (emails, witnesses), provide that."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employee complained about me but I was just being friendly. How is that harassment?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Harassment is defined by impact, not intent. Behavior you consider friendly—compliments, touching, personal questions, repeated invitations—can be unwelcome and create a hostile environment for the recipient. The legal question isn't whether you meant harm but whether a reasonable person in their position would find the conduct hostile or offensive. Take the complaint seriously rather than defending your intent. Ask HR or the investigator specifically what behavior was unwelcome so you understand the concern. This is an opportunity to adjust your behavior, not prove you're a good person."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm the only one who got written up even though everyone does the same thing. Is that discrimination?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Selective enforcement can be evidence of discrimination if you're being singled out because of a protected characteristic (race, sex, age, etc.) or retaliation for protected activity. Document specific examples of others doing the same thing without consequences. Note any patterns—are others who weren't disciplined of a different race, sex, or age? Did the selective enforcement start after you complained about something? Disparate treatment is actionable if the reason is discriminatory. Raise the inconsistency with HR in writing, and if it continues, consider filing with the EEOC."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I reported safety issues and now my hours got cut. But they say it's just business reasons."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timing matters significantly in retaliation cases. If your hours were cut shortly after reporting safety issues, that's circumstantial evidence of retaliation, regardless of the stated reason. Document the timeline: when you reported, when hours were cut. Compare your hours to others—did anyone else get cut? Were you singled out? 'Business reasons' is the go-to excuse for retaliatory actions. If you can show the stated reason is pretextual (your hours were cut but demand is high, others weren't cut, or your hours dropped while theirs didn't), that strengthens your case. File an OSHA retaliation complaint within 30 days."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"How do I know if I'm being gaslighted at work about my own experience?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Gaslighting at work often looks like: being told you misunderstood clear statements, having documented events denied ('that meeting never happened'), being told your normal reactions are 'overreacting,' having concerns dismissed as you being too sensitive, or having your memory or perception questioned repeatedly. Trust your documentation over others' characterizations. Keep contemporaneous notes—write down what happened immediately after. Save emails and communications. If multiple people are telling you your documented experience didn't happen, that's a pattern. Having outside perspective (therapist, trusted friend outside work) helps when your perception is being undermined."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I complained about harassment but now I'm being excluded from meetings and projects."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Exclusion after complaining is textbook retaliation. Being cut out of meetings, removed from projects, isolated from colleagues, or denied opportunities you previously had are all adverse employment actions when they follow protected activity. Document every instance: which meetings, which projects, compared to before the complaint. Report the retaliation to HR in writing—this is a separate complaint from the original harassment. If HR doesn't address it, file with the EEOC. Retaliation claims can succeed even if the original harassment claim doesn't. The company has an obligation to ensure complainants aren't penalized."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss said I'd be a great fit for the role but I 'might be starting a family soon.' Can they not hire me for that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"That's pregnancy discrimination, which is illegal under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Employers cannot make hiring decisions based on pregnancy, potential pregnancy, or assumptions about family planning. The comment reveals discriminatory reasoning. Document exactly what was said, when, and any witnesses. If you're not hired, you have a strong case—they've stated an illegal reason. Even if you are hired, this comment can be relevant to future claims if you face discrimination later. File an EEOC complaint if you're denied the role. Employers learn they can't make these comments by facing consequences when they do."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I asked for a raise and was told no because 'you have a husband who works.'"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is explicit sex discrimination. Basing pay decisions on marital status, spouse's income, or assumptions about financial need tied to gender is illegal under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act. A man wouldn't be told he doesn't need a raise because his wife works. Document the exact statement, when it was said, and any witnesses. File an EEOC complaint. This kind of statement is direct evidence of discriminatory intent—it's often harder to prove discrimination, but they've told you the illegal reason outright. You may also want to research what similarly situated male colleagues earn."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My coworker reported me for something I didn't do. Can I sue them for defamation?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Defamation requires a false statement of fact that damages your reputation, made without privilege. Internal workplace complaints are typically protected—there's a qualified privilege for good-faith reports to employers about workplace issues. Even if the claim is untrue, if they genuinely believed it when reporting, that's usually protected. You'd need to prove they knowingly lied with malicious intent, which is a high bar. Your better route is cooperating with the investigation, providing your evidence, and being cleared. If you're cleared and still suffer consequences, address that with the employer. Defamation suits against coworkers are rarely successful."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I was written up for violating a policy that doesn't exist. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Request the policy in writing. If they can't produce it, document that. Respond to the write-up in writing, noting that you requested the policy and it wasn't provided. Check your employee handbook and any documents you were given at hiring. If the 'policy' was never communicated, your write-up is problematic. If this feels like pretext for something else (discrimination, retaliation), document that context. You can grieve through HR or, if unionized, through your union. If you believe it's discriminatory or retaliatory, file with the EEOC. Keep copies of everything."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"They promoted someone less qualified than me. How do I prove it was discrimination?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Circumstantial evidence matters: your qualifications versus theirs (document specifics), any discriminatory comments by decision-makers, patterns of promoting certain groups over others, the stated reasons and whether they hold up. Direct evidence (discriminatory statements) is rare—most cases rely on showing you were qualified, someone outside your protected class got the job, and the stated reasons are pretextual. Request feedback on why you weren't selected in writing. If the reasons seem weak or shifting, that's evidence. Check if this is a pattern—have others in your protected class been passed over? An employment attorney can assess whether you have enough evidence."},{"role":"user","content":"But they say the other person 'interviewed better.' How do I fight that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"'Interviewed better' is subjective and hard to disprove, which is why it's a common pretext. Look for inconsistencies: Were interview criteria documented beforehand? Did they apply the same criteria to everyone? Have they used 'interviewed better' to justify promoting people from one group consistently? Request interview scores or evaluations if they exist. Note who conducted interviews—bias often enters through subjective assessment. Compare your experience and qualifications on paper. If 'interviewed better' doesn't align with the stated job requirements or your track record, that inconsistency matters. Pattern evidence across multiple decisions strengthens your case."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer change my job duties without changing my pay?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally yes, if you're at-will with no contract specifying duties. Employers can reassign work as business needs change. However, if the change is discriminatory (giving worse duties to protected classes), retaliatory (after complaints), or so significant it constitutes constructive discharge (forcing you to quit), that's actionable. If duties increase substantially without pay increase, you can negotiate or job search, but absent a contract, there's no legal requirement to maintain your duties. If the change affects your exempt status (taking away management duties while keeping you salaried), that might affect overtime eligibility."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work the same hours as everyone else but they're all classified as employees and I'm a contractor. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"That's a red flag for misclassification. If you and employees work the same hours, follow the same rules, use the same equipment, and do the same work, there may be no legitimate basis for classifying you differently. Misclassification denies you benefits, protections, and often costs you money (self-employment tax). Review IRS guidelines and your state's classification tests. If you're treated identically to employees in practice, you may be misclassified. You can file Form SS-8 with the IRS for a determination, or file with your state labor agency. You may be entitled to back benefits and reclassification."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss says there's no budget for raises but just bought a new company car. Can I do anything?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Frustrating, but generally not illegal. Employers aren't required to spend money fairly—they can prioritize executive perks over employee raises. However, if raises are being denied to certain groups while others receive them, that could be discriminatory. If you're being denied a raise after protected activity (complaint, leave request), that could be retaliation. Otherwise, this is a negotiation and job-market issue, not a legal one. You can push back: document your value, make a case for the raise, and explore other opportunities. Employers who underpay often lose good employees to competitors willing to pay fairly."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I got a bad reference from my old employer and now I can't get hired. Can I sue?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Potentially, if the reference was false. Employers can give negative but truthful references—opinions on performance, factual reasons for termination. They can't lie. If they're saying false things that are damaging your ability to get work, that's defamation. Proving it requires knowing what they're saying—you can use reference-checking services or have someone call pretending to be a prospective employer. Many employers have policies limiting references to dates of employment and title to avoid liability. If you discover falsehoods, document them and consult an attorney. Some states also have blacklisting laws if an employer is deliberately sabotaging your job search."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer said I can't discuss politics at work. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally yes in private workplaces. The First Amendment protects you from government censorship, not employer policies. Private employers can restrict political speech at work. However, some political speech intersects with protected activity—discussing unionization, workplace conditions, or wages is protected under the NLRA regardless of political framing. Some states protect lawful off-duty political activity. And policies can't be applied discriminatorily (only enforcing against certain viewpoints). If you're disciplined for political speech, check if it overlaps with protected activity and whether the policy is applied evenhandedly."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Someone recorded me without consent at work. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Depends on state law and context. In one-party consent states, someone can record conversations they're part of without telling you. In two-party (all-party) consent states like California, all participants must consent. Workplace expectations of privacy also matter—conversations in open areas have less protection than private offices. Company policy may also restrict recording. If you're in a two-party state and were recorded without consent, you may have legal recourse. If the recording captured you saying something problematic, that's a separate issue from the legality of the recording itself."},{"role":"user","content":"They're using it against me in an HR investigation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Illegally obtained evidence can sometimes still be used in employment investigations—the exclusionary rule applies to criminal cases, not workplace HR. However, if the recording violated state law, the recorder may face consequences. Raise the issue: note that the recording was made without your consent and may violate state wiretapping law if applicable. Ask HR to investigate how it was obtained. Even if they use it, the illegal recording may affect the recorder's credibility or result in their own discipline. Consult an attorney about your specific state's laws and whether you have any claims against the person who recorded you."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm religious and need Sundays off but my employer schedules me anyway. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Employers must provide reasonable religious accommodations under Title VII unless it causes undue hardship. The standard for undue hardship in religious accommodation cases is lower than ADA cases—more than de minimis cost. However, the employer must engage in an interactive process to find solutions. They can't just say no without trying. Solutions might include shift swaps, flexible scheduling, or voluntary substitutes. If they haven't attempted to accommodate and just schedule you anyway, that may be discrimination. Document your requests and their responses, and file with the EEOC if they won't work with you."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm a cashier and my register is short. Can they deduct it from my paycheck?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This varies by state. Federal law allows deductions for cash shortages if it doesn't take you below minimum wage, but many states restrict or prohibit deductions for cash shortages, breakage, or losses. Some states require written consent before any deductions; others only allow deductions if the employee was clearly negligent or dishonest. Check your state law. If deductions are illegal in your state, file a wage claim. Even where legal, employers should have clear policies communicated in advance, and arbitrary deductions for shortages can mask employer negligence (poor security, inadequate procedures)."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My manager calls me 'sweetie' and 'honey.' Is that harassment?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Patronizing terms like 'sweetie' and 'honey' can contribute to a hostile work environment, especially if directed at one gender. A single instance likely isn't actionable alone, but a pattern of diminishing language combined with other behavior can constitute harassment. Ask them to stop using those terms—'I prefer to be called by my name.' If they continue after you've objected, document each instance. The pattern of continuation after objection strengthens any claim. It may also violate company policy regardless of whether it meets the legal harassment threshold."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm trans and my employer refuses to use my correct name and pronouns. What are my rights?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Deliberate misgendering and deadnaming can constitute harassment based on sex or gender identity. The EEOC has taken the position that this violates Title VII. Many states and localities have explicit gender identity protections. Persistent intentional refusal after correction creates a hostile environment. Document each incident. Report to HR if you have supportive HR. If internal processes fail or don't exist, file with the EEOC or your state civil rights agency. Some employers have specific policies protecting transgender employees—check your employee handbook. Legal protections for transgender workers have expanded significantly through recent court decisions."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My workplace has 'jokes' about my accent. Is that discrimination?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, mockery or 'jokes' about someone's accent can constitute national origin discrimination or harassment. Accents are tied to national origin, a protected characteristic. If the jokes are creating a hostile environment—you feel embarrassed, targeted, or your work is affected—document specific incidents. Report to HR. If it continues after reporting, or if the company fails to address it, you have grounds for an EEOC complaint. Even if individuals claim they're 'just joking,' harassment law looks at whether a reasonable person would find the environment hostile. Mockery of accents meets that standard when persistent."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer found out I have a criminal record and wants to fire me. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Depends on jurisdiction and circumstances. Some states and cities have 'ban the box' laws restricting when criminal history can be considered. Federal guidance says using criminal records to screen employees can have disparate impact on protected groups and may violate Title VII if not job-related. If the conviction is old, unrelated to the job, or you've shown rehabilitation, termination may be challengeable. However, some jobs legally require background checks (childcare, healthcare, finance), and convictions relevant to job duties may be legitimate grounds. Check your state's laws on criminal record discrimination."},{"role":"user","content":"The conviction is from 15 years ago and completely unrelated to my job."},{"role":"assistant","content":"A 15-year-old conviction unrelated to your job duties significantly strengthens your position. EEOC guidance specifically considers time since conviction and relevance to job duties. If your employer can't articulate a job-related business necessity for termination, it may be discriminatory, particularly if criminal-record policies disproportionately affect protected groups. Document your good work record since being hired. Check if your state has specific protections for employees with old or irrelevant convictions. Consult an employment attorney—this is a developing area of law and you may have more protection than you realize."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer is requiring us to speak English only, even on breaks. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"English-only rules are scrutinized under national origin discrimination laws. Blanket rules requiring English at all times, including breaks and personal conversations, are generally viewed as discriminatory by the EEOC. English requirements must be justified by business necessity—safety communication, customer interaction—and should be limited to when that necessity applies. Prohibiting employees from speaking their native language on breaks or among themselves typically isn't justified. If your employer has a blanket English-only policy, file an EEOC complaint. Limited rules for specific safety or business contexts are more defensible."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I got hurt at work but my employer says it's my fault so they won't file a workers' comp claim. Is that right?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. Workers' compensation is a no-fault system—you're covered regardless of who caused the injury. Your employer cannot refuse to file or deny your claim based on fault. The only exceptions are typically intentional self-injury, intoxication, or fighting—and even then, fault doesn't automatically bar recovery. Report your injury in writing to create a record. If your employer refuses to file a claim, you can file directly with your state's workers' comp agency. Your employer is legally required to report workplace injuries and retaliation for filing a claim is illegal."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I need FMLA leave but my employer says I haven't worked there long enough. How do I know if that's true?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"FMLA eligibility requires: 12 months of employment (doesn't have to be consecutive), 1,250 hours worked in the last 12 months (roughly 25 hours/week), and your employer must have 50+ employees within 75 miles. Calculate your hours—if you're close to 1,250, review timesheets carefully. Some employers undercount hours to deny FMLA. Note that some states have their own family leave laws with different eligibility requirements that may cover you even if FMLA doesn't. If you believe you meet federal or state requirements and your employer disagrees, consult an attorney or file a complaint with the Department of Labor."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer requires me to be on call but doesn't pay me for that time. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"It depends on restrictions during on-call time. If you must stay on-premises or so close that you can't use the time for personal activities, that's generally compensable hours. If you just need to be reachable by phone but can otherwise live your life, that's typically not compensable. Factors include: how quickly you must respond, geographic restrictions, frequency of calls, and whether you can trade on-call with others. If on-call time is heavily restricted and you're non-exempt, you may be owed wages for that time. Document the restrictions and consult your state's specific rules, as some are more protective."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My company is being acquired. What happens to my rights and benefits?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"It depends on how the acquisition is structured. In an asset sale, the new owner typically isn't bound by the old company's obligations—your employment may restart fresh. In a stock sale, obligations usually continue. Your employment contract, if any, may have change-of-control provisions. Collective bargaining agreements typically survive acquisitions. Benefits often change: review communications about whether plans continue, are replaced, or have gaps. Ask about: PTO payout, pension/401k vesting and rollover, healthcare continuity, and severance if your position is eliminated. Get changes in writing—verbal promises during acquisitions often evaporate."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I work for a small company (under 15 employees). Do discrimination laws still apply?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Federal Title VII covers employers with 15+ employees, ADEA covers 20+, and ADA covers 15+. Below those thresholds, federal laws don't apply. However, many states have anti-discrimination laws with lower thresholds—some cover all employers. Check your state's civil rights laws. Additionally, the Section 1981 race discrimination prohibition (from the Civil Rights Act of 1866) has no size requirement—you can sue any employer for race discrimination. Some local ordinances also cover small employers. You likely have more protection than federal minimums suggest."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer force me to use my own car for work and not reimburse me?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Legally, in most states yes, as long as it doesn't reduce your effective pay below minimum wage. However, California and some other states require reimbursement of necessary business expenses, including mileage. Even where not required, if you're non-exempt and unreimbursed expenses take your pay below minimum wage, that's a violation. You should also check your auto insurance—personal policies often don't cover business use, and an accident during work use could leave you uninsured. Negotiate mileage reimbursement if possible, and document your work-related miles regardless."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I've been asked to train my replacement before being laid off. Can I refuse?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You can refuse, but you may face consequences—loss of severance, immediate termination, or negative references. If you're hoping to negotiate severance or need the paycheck until your end date, compliance may be strategic. Consider whether refusing provides you any benefit versus costs. If you're being asked to train someone because you're being replaced due to discrimination (your replacement is younger, for example), document that—it's evidence for a potential claim. If you suspect the 'layoff' is pretextual and you're actually being fired for illegal reasons, consult an attorney before your end date."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer says remote work was temporary and I have to return to the office, but I have a disability. What are my options?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"If remote work was effective during the temporary period and you have a disability that makes it necessary, it may be a reasonable accommodation the employer must consider. The ADA requires interactive process—they can't just say no without discussion. Document: how remote work enabled you to do your job, your medical need for the accommodation, and their refusal. If they refuse without engaging in the interactive process or considering alternatives, that may be a failure to accommodate. File with the EEOC if they deny without legitimate reasons. The success of remote work during the temporary period is strong evidence it's a reasonable accommodation."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A customer harassed me and my employer won't do anything. Am I protected?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, employers have a duty to protect employees from harassment by third parties (customers, clients, vendors) when they know about it and fail to act. They can't control what customers do initially, but once you report it, they must take reasonable steps: warning the customer, banning them, reassigning you so you don't interact with them, or providing support. If they do nothing and the harassment continues, the employer becomes liable for the hostile environment. Document your reports and their inaction. This is an often-overlooked protection—you're not required to tolerate customer harassment as part of your job."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I signed an arbitration agreement when I was hired. Does that mean I can't sue?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"It means disputes will go to arbitration rather than court—you can still pursue claims, just through a different process. Arbitration can be faster and cheaper, but critics argue it favors employers. Review your agreement: does it cover all claims or only some? Is the arbitrator selection fair? Some states limit mandatory arbitration for certain claims (sexual harassment in some places). EEOC complaints are separate—you can always file with the EEOC even with an arbitration agreement. An employment attorney can assess whether your specific agreement is enforceable and whether arbitration or agency complaints are your best path."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My former employer is disputing my unemployment claim. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Respond to every request for information from the unemployment agency promptly and thoroughly. Gather documentation: your employment records, any termination letter, performance reviews, and communications about why you left or were fired. For the hearing, prepare to explain your side clearly. If you were fired, the question is whether it was for misconduct (disqualifying) or other reasons (typically not disqualifying). If you quit, you need to show good cause (hostile conditions, safety issues, following a spouse). Employer claims that you quit when you were fired, or exaggerated misconduct, should be countered with documentation. You can represent yourself, but consider legal help for complex cases."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"What's the statute of limitations for employment discrimination claims?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"For EEOC complaints, you have 180 days from the discriminatory act, extended to 300 days if your state has its own fair employment agency. After the EEOC process (you get a right-to-sue letter), you have 90 days to file in court. State law claims may have different timelines—some states allow 1-3 years. Continuing violations (ongoing harassment) can extend deadlines because each incident restarts the clock. Retaliation claims have their own timelines (OSHA retaliation is 30 days). Don't wait—statute of limitations is often how otherwise valid claims get dismissed. Consult an attorney early to preserve your rights."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss yelled at me in front of everyone. Can I sue for emotional distress?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Being yelled at, while unpleasant, is generally not actionable unless it's based on a protected characteristic (creating a hostile environment) or is so extreme it meets the high bar for intentional infliction of emotional distress (outrageous conduct exceeding all bounds of decency). Ordinary workplace rudeness, even humiliating, isn't illegal. However, if the yelling includes slurs, is part of a pattern targeting your protected class, or follows protected activity (complaint, leave request), that changes the analysis. Document the incident, note any patterns, and report to HR if you believe it crosses a line. You can also simply job search—toxic management is worth leaving even when legal."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I want to record conversations with my boss for evidence. Is that okay?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Depends on your state. In one-party consent states (the majority), you can record conversations you're part of without telling the other person. In two-party/all-party consent states (California, Florida, Illinois, and others), all participants must consent. Check your state law. Also check company policy—even if legal, recording may violate workplace rules and could result in termination (though if you're recording harassment evidence, retaliation for doing so could be actionable). If you proceed, ensure the recording clearly captures what you need. Consider whether the risk is worth the evidence value."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"HR told me my complaint is 'unfounded' but didn't investigate. What now?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A conclusion without investigation is suspicious. Request details: who was interviewed, what evidence was reviewed, what their findings were. If they can't provide this, they didn't conduct a real investigation. Put your concerns about the process in writing to HR and escalate to higher management or legal/compliance if your company has them. If internal processes are clearly inadequate, you can file directly with the EEOC—companies are required to conduct prompt and thorough investigations, and a sham investigation doesn't satisfy that. The inadequate response itself becomes part of your claim."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm a contractor and got hurt on the job. Am I covered by workers' comp?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally no—independent contractors aren't covered by the client company's workers' comp. You'd need your own coverage or to sue for negligence. However, if you're misclassified (you should be an employee), you may be entitled to workers' comp. Classification depends on control, equipment, and economic reality, not what you're called. If you work like an employee (set hours, their equipment, their direction), challenge the classification. Some states have specific rules for construction and other industries. Report the injury regardless, document everything, and consult an attorney if it's serious. Misclassification cases often emerge after workplace injuries."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer changed my schedule to conflict with my childcare. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally yes, unless you have a contract specifying your schedule. However, if the change specifically targets parents (especially mothers) while accommodating others, that could be family status or sex discrimination. If you requested a schedule accommodation related to a disability or pregnancy, refusal might violate ADA or PDA. If the change came after protected activity (complaint, leave), it could be retaliation. Document whether others with childcare conflicts are treated differently. You can request a flexible schedule, but if denied for legitimate business reasons and it's not discriminatory, your options are limited to negotiating or finding a job with compatible hours."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Someone made a false OSHA complaint against me. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"OSHA investigates complaints, not accusers, so focus on the investigation itself. Cooperate fully and provide evidence that the complaint is unfounded—documents, witness statements, photos. If OSHA finds no violation, that's the end of it. False complaints are frustrating but generally not actionable unless made with actual malice (knowingly false with intent to harm), which is hard to prove. If you know who made the complaint and can prove it was knowingly false and caused you concrete harm (lost job, costs), consult an attorney about defamation. However, in practice, the best outcome is OSHA clearing you quickly."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My company wants me to sign a performance improvement plan. Should I?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"PIPs serve two purposes: genuine improvement plans or documentation for termination. Evaluate which this is. Signs it's legitimate: specific, achievable goals, adequate support and time, supervisor invested in your success. Signs it's a paper trail: vague goals, impossible timelines, supervisor who's already checked out. You can usually sign acknowledging receipt without agreeing to the contents—add a note: 'Signature acknowledges receipt, not agreement.' Respond in writing to anything you dispute. A PIP may be the beginning of the end, so also start job searching. If you believe the PIP is discriminatory or retaliatory, document that context."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer said I'm being fired for 'poor culture fit.' Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"'Culture fit' is legal but often masks discrimination—it's a vague, subjective standard that can cover bias. If 'culture fit' correlates with protected characteristics (people of your race, gender, or age are consistently deemed poor fits), that's evidence of discrimination. Document: who else has been fired or not hired for 'culture fit,' any patterns in who's considered a 'fit,' and any discriminatory comments. Request specifics: what exactly about your performance or behavior led to this conclusion? Vague answers suggest pretext. If you can show 'culture fit' is selectively applied against protected groups, you have a potential discrimination claim."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I witnessed discrimination against a coworker. Can I file a complaint on their behalf?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You can report what you witnessed to HR or management—in fact, in some roles (supervisors, HR), you may be obligated to. You can also file a complaint with the EEOC as a witness, though the EEOC typically needs the affected person to be the charging party. If you face retaliation for reporting discrimination against someone else, you have your own retaliation claim—protection extends to witnesses who participate in investigations or oppose discriminatory practices. Support your coworker, document what you saw, and offer to be a witness if they file. Your participation strengthens their case."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer is asking me to falsify safety records. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This is illegal and you're protected if you refuse or report it. OSHA requires accurate injury logs; falsifying them violates federal law. Refuse in writing: document the request, who made it, and your refusal. Report to OSHA—this is exactly the kind of retaliation-protected activity whistleblower laws exist for. If you're fired or punished for refusing to falsify records or for reporting the request, that's unlawful retaliation. Keep copies of everything off-site. Consider consulting a whistleblower attorney—some violations carry rewards for reporters, and attorneys often work on contingency for these cases."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm being treated differently after returning from maternity leave. Is that discrimination?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Differential treatment after maternity leave can be pregnancy discrimination, which is illegal under the PDA. Common forms: losing your position, demotion, reduced responsibilities, being mommy-tracked (assumed to be less committed), or hostile treatment. Compare your situation to before leave: same role, responsibilities, pay? Compare to others who took other types of leave. Document changes and any comments about your leave, motherhood, or commitment. If your employer treated you differently because you took pregnancy leave or because you're now a mother, that's actionable. File with the EEOC if internal complaints don't resolve it."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can I be fired for calling in sick?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"In at-will employment, generally yes for occasional absences, unless you have an employment contract or union agreement, the illness triggers FMLA or ADA protections, you're using accrued paid sick leave where required by law, or termination is retaliation for protected activity. If you have a serious health condition requiring ongoing treatment, that may be FMLA-qualifying. If you have a disability requiring occasional absences, that may require ADA accommodation. Check your state's paid sick leave laws—many prohibit retaliation for using accrued leave. If you suspect termination was really about protected characteristics or activity, consult an attorney."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My company says they can't afford to pay me what they owe. What can I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your employer's financial difficulties don't excuse wage theft. You're owed what you earned, period. File a wage claim with your state labor agency or the Department of Labor. You can also sue in small claims court (for smaller amounts) or consult an employment attorney. If the company is going bankrupt, wage claims have priority over many other debts. Document what you're owed with pay stubs, time records, and employment agreements. Don't accept promises to pay later without getting them in writing. The 'can't afford it' excuse often means they're choosing to pay other creditors first—your wages should be prioritized."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I got in trouble for discussing unionization with coworkers during breaks. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No—your employer violated the National Labor Relations Act. Discussing unions during non-work time (breaks, lunch, before/after shifts) is protected concerted activity. Your employer cannot prohibit these discussions, discipline you for them, or treat union talk differently than other personal conversations. If others can discuss sports or weekend plans on break, you can discuss unionization. File an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB. Common employer tactics—prohibiting 'solicitation,' monitoring union discussions, disciplining organizers—often violate the NLRA. Don't be intimidated; your rights are clearly established."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer wants me to sign a non-disparagement agreement as part of a severance package. What should I know?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Non-disparagement clauses prevent you from saying negative things about the company. Consider: what specifically is prohibited (factual statements? opinions?), are there exceptions for legal proceedings or reporting to agencies, and is it mutual (does the company also agree not to disparage you)? Broad clauses can prevent you from reviewing the company online, discussing problems with former coworkers, or even being candid in job interviews. You may be able to negotiate narrower language. Some states limit non-disparagement in settlement agreements for harassment claims. Don't sign under pressure—you usually have time to review. Consider whether the severance is worth the restriction."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"HR asked me to sign something saying I won't file a complaint with any government agency. Can they do that?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No. You cannot waive your right to file complaints with the EEOC, OSHA, SEC, or other government agencies. Any agreement purporting to prohibit such filings is unenforceable as to that provision. You can always file agency complaints regardless of what you signed. However, agreements can limit remedies—you might waive certain monetary relief while retaining the right to file. If an employer is asking you to sign away your right to contact government agencies, that's a red flag suggesting they're trying to cover something up. Refuse to sign or note the provision is unenforceable."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"A coworker keeps telling me I should smile more. Is that harassment?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Repeated comments about smiling, particularly directed at women, can contribute to a hostile work environment based on sex. 'Smile more' is a gendered comment rarely directed at men. Document each instance—dates, context, witnesses. Tell them to stop: 'I'd prefer you not comment on my facial expressions.' If it continues after you've asked them to stop, report to HR. A single comment probably isn't actionable alone, but a pattern, especially if coupled with other gendered behavior, supports a harassment claim. The cumulative effect of many 'minor' incidents can create a hostile environment."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My boss keeps assigning me grunt work while giving better projects to others. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Legal unless it's based on a protected characteristic. If grunt work assignments correlate with race, sex, age, or another protected class—women get administrative tasks while men get high-profile projects, for example—that's discriminatory. Document the pattern: who gets what assignments, qualifications of people getting better work, any comments suggesting bias. If it started after protected activity (complaint, leave), it could be retaliation. Compare similarly qualified people across protected class lines. If there's no discriminatory pattern and your boss just doesn't like you, that's unfair but legal. Your options are discussing it directly, going to HR, or finding a better job."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I need medical leave but I'm still on probation. Do I have any protection?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"FMLA only applies if you've worked 12 months and 1,250 hours. During probation, you likely don't qualify for FMLA. However, you may have other protections: ADA requires reasonable accommodations including leave for disability, regardless of tenure. Some states have family leave laws with lower eligibility thresholds. Pregnancy leave has some protections. Even without legal protection, many employers grant leave during probation if you communicate professionally. Document your request and the response. If you're denied leave and suspect it's because of disability or pregnancy, you may have an ADA or PDA claim even as a new employee."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I got a severance agreement that says I can't work for competitors for 2 years. Should I sign?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"A 2-year non-compete is lengthy and can seriously limit your career options. Evaluate: how is 'competitor' defined (broad or narrow?), what geographic area, and what severance are you getting in return? Non-competes are increasingly unenforceable—check your state (California bans them entirely, others limit them). Even enforceable non-competes must be reasonable in scope. You can negotiate: shorter duration, narrower definition of competitors, geographic limits, or more severance in exchange. Don't sign immediately—you usually have time to review. An employment attorney can assess enforceability and help negotiate better terms. The leverage is: they want your signature; you don't have to give it."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer is retaliating against me by giving me glowing performance reviews."},{"role":"assistant","content":"That's an unusual claim—positive reviews are generally not adverse employment actions. Courts look at whether employer actions would dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity. Positive reviews don't typically qualify. However, context matters: if the reviews are clearly inflated and setting you up for failure (giving you responsibilities you can't handle), or if good reviews create a paper trail contradicting a future pretextual termination, document that. If you believe something problematic is happening despite positive reviews, focus on concrete adverse actions: denied promotion, reduced pay, changed duties, ostracism. Those are actionable; the reviews themselves likely aren't."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"Can my employer require me to get vaccinated?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generally yes, with important exceptions. Private employers can require vaccinations as a condition of employment. However, they must accommodate: medical conditions that prevent vaccination (ADA), and sincerely held religious beliefs (Title VII). Accommodation might mean masking, testing, remote work, or reassignment—it doesn't automatically mean exemption without any alternative measures. If you need an accommodation, request it formally and engage in the interactive process. If denied without good reason, you may have a claim. Some states have laws limiting vaccine mandates, so check local rules. The process matters—employers must consider accommodations, not just say 'get vaccinated or be fired.'"}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My workplace bathroom is dirty and has no supplies. Is that a violation?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes. OSHA requires employers to provide adequate, sanitary toilet facilities with running water, soap, and toilet paper. Bathrooms must be kept in sanitary condition. Denial of bathroom access or inadequate facilities is a citable OSHA violation. Document the conditions (photos if possible), report to management, and if nothing changes, file an OSHA complaint. This is a basic workplace requirement. Additionally, some states have specific workplace sanitation standards that may be more stringent than federal OSHA. You're entitled to clean, functional, stocked bathrooms during your workday."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I'm being bullied by a coworker but HR won't do anything because it's not 'illegal' harassment. What are my options?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Workplace bullying that's not based on protected characteristics often falls outside legal protections, but you still have options. Check if your employer has anti-bullying policies—violations can result in discipline even if not illegal. Document everything and continue escalating: HR supervisor, your manager's manager, employee relations. If the bullying is affecting your health, a doctor's documentation can support accommodation requests or leave. If you develop a documented medical condition from the bullying, that might become an ADA issue. You can also consult an attorney to confirm there's truly no legal angle—sometimes harassment is based on protected characteristics that aren't obvious at first."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My manager asked if I'm planning to have kids in my interview. I got the job, but should I report it?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You can report it. Even though you weren't harmed by the question (you got the job), the question itself reveals potential pregnancy discrimination in hiring. Reporting creates a record in case the company discriminates against you or others later. It also alerts HR to a manager who's asking illegal questions and may help other candidates who weren't hired. That said, consider the dynamics—reporting may affect your relationship with this manager. You could report to HR confidentially or wait to see if discriminatory patterns emerge. Documenting the question and date protects you if you face discrimination later and need to show a pattern."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I overheard my manager say they won't promote anyone who takes FMLA. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"That statement indicates FMLA interference or discrimination, which is illegal. Document exactly what was said, when, and any witnesses. Report it to HR—this protects you if you need FMLA leave later and establishes the company knew about the discriminatory attitude. If you've taken FMLA and been denied promotion, you have a strong case. Even if you haven't yet, the statement creates potential liability the company should address. If HR doesn't act and you later need FMLA, the documented statement becomes evidence. Consider consulting an employment attorney if you've already experienced negative consequences for FMLA use."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My job posting advertised one salary but they offered me less. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"In most states, job postings don't create binding contracts—employers can offer different terms. However, some states with pay transparency laws (Colorado, Washington, California, New York) require salary ranges in postings and may have enforcement mechanisms if actual offers don't align. Check your state. Even where legal, bait-and-switch tactics are a red flag about the employer. You can negotiate: 'The posting listed $X range. I expected an offer within that range. Can we discuss?' If they won't negotiate, consider whether this employer is worth working for. The practice may also indicate pay disparities worth examining—are they lowballing certain groups?"}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My employer demoted me while I was on medical leave. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Probably not. Under FMLA, you're entitled to return to the same or an equivalent position. Demoting you during leave violates that protection. Under ADA, adverse actions during disability-related leave can be discrimination. Document what position you held before leave versus what you returned to—duties, title, pay, reporting structure. If any are substantially worse, that's an adverse action. Request explanation in writing. If their reason doesn't hold up (restructuring that only affected you, claimed performance issues that don't match your record), that suggests pretext. File with the EEOC or DOL Wage and Hour Division if the employer won't restore your position."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I think I'm being set up to fail. What should I do?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Signs of being set up to fail: impossible deadlines, inadequate resources, contradictory instructions, exclusion from necessary information, sudden negative feedback after a history of good performance, documentation of minor issues. Document everything: save emails, note verbal instructions, create paper trails for resource requests and their denials. When given unrealistic assignments, respond in writing noting concerns: 'This timeline seems tight given X constraints. Can you clarify priorities?' CC yourself. Build external documentation (personal email, home computer) since you may lose access suddenly. Start job searching. If the setup correlates with protected activity or characteristics, consult an attorney before termination."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"My company just got bought and the new owners are cutting all the older workers. Is that legal?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"If layoffs disproportionately affect workers 40 and older, that's potential ADEA age discrimination. Look for patterns: are older workers being cut while younger, less experienced employees stay? Are they using criteria that correlate with age (tenure, salary level, being 'overqualified')? The fact of an acquisition doesn't immunize discrimination. Document who's being cut versus retained and their ages. If enough workers over 40 are affected, this could be a class action. Individual workers can also file EEOC complaints. Consult an employment attorney—age discrimination in post-acquisition layoffs is a recognized pattern. The new owners inherit legal obligations."}]}
{"chat":[{"role":"user","content":"I disclosed a disability during the interactive accommodation process and now I'm being treated differently. Is that retaliation?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Changed treatment after disability disclosure can be both ADA discrimination and retaliation for requesting accommodation. The interactive process itself is protected—you can't be penalized for engaging in it. Document the timeline: when you disclosed, requested accommodation, and when treatment changed. Note specifics: exclusion from meetings, different assignments, negative comments, scrutiny you didn't face before. Compare to similarly situated employees without disabilities. If the employer claims legitimate reasons, assess whether they hold up—pretextual reasons are common. File with the EEOC. Employers are supposed to engage in good faith; punishing you for requesting what you're legally entitled to is unlawful."}]}
